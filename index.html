                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h4>My name is Spencer Smith and I'm the world's biggest baseball fan</h4>
                <p>Born and raised in Euless, Texas, I could never dream of calling another state my home.  I graduated with my bachelors in music education from the University of Houston in 2015, spending the first two years of my career as an assistant band director at Klein Oak High School in Klein ISD.  Looking to move a little closer to home, I later pursued a job as an assistant band director in Prosper ISD where I have taught since 2017.</p>

                        <h2>Python</h2>
                        <p>I started learning Python in September of 2019 in an attempt to automate my least-favorite band director tasks. Along the way, I fell in love with data visualization libraries like Pandas and NumPy. </p>

                            <p>My hope is that my life will have ultimately been better measured by my experiences than my possessions. In 2018 I flew solo to Africa to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, and by 2027 I plan to have attempted to climb both Denali and Aconcagua.</p>

                            <p>At one week old, my father took me to my first Texas Rangers game and I never looked back. My interest was only compounded by the introduction of StatCast in 2015, which led to a strong desire for deeper analytical understanding.</p>
